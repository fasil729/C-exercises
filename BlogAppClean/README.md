# Clean Architecture Summary

## Introduction

Clean architecture, also referred to as onion architecture, hexagonal architecture, or ports and adapters, is a domain-centric approach to organizing dependencies within a software system. It emphasizes focusing on the core domain model and separating it from infrastructure concerns.

## Key Principles of Clean Architecture

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Clean architecture promotes the separation of different concerns within the application.
   - Each component should have a single responsibility and focus on a specific aspect of the system.

2. **Dependency Rule**:
   - Dependencies should flow inward, with higher-level layers depending on lower-level layers.
   - This ensures that changes in lower-level layers do not affect higher-level layers.

3. **Layered Architecture**:
   - Clean architecture follows a layered structure, with distinct layers representing different responsibilities.
   - Each layer should only depend on the layer directly beneath it.

4. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Clean architecture encourages the use of dependency injection to manage dependencies between components.
   - This allows for loose coupling and easier testing and maintenance.

## Key Points Related to Clean Architecture

1. **Application Built Around Business Logic**:
2. **Isolation from External Environment**:
3. **Technology and Framework Agnostic**:
4. **Isolation from User Interface**:
5. **Isolation from Database**:
6. **Isolation from External Agencies**:

## Importance of Clean Architecture

Clean architecture offers several important benefits for software development:

- **Maintainability**:
- **Testability**:
- **Flexibility**:
- **Scalability**:
- **Understandability**:

## Core rules

Clean architecture is governed by three key rules:

1. **Model all business rules and entities in the core project**:
   - The core project represents the heart of the application, containing the business logic and entities.
   - This ensures that the core remains independent of specific technologies or frameworks.

2. **All dependencies flow toward the core project**:
   - Dependencies are directed inward, with the core project being the central point of the architecture.
   - This maintains a clear separation of concerns and prevents the core from being entangled with infrastructure details.

3. **Inner projects define interfaces, outer projects implement them**:
   - The core project defines interfaces that outer projects, such as the UI or data access layers, implement.
   - This enables loose coupling and allows for easy interchangeability of components.

## Advantages of Clean Architecture

Clean architecture offers several benefits for software development:

- **Testability**:
  - The separation of the core from infrastructure makes it easier to write unit tests for the business rules.
  - Testability improves the overall maintainability and reliability of the codebase.

- **Easier code changes**:
  - Modifications to the outer layers can be made without affecting the core business logic.
  - Changes can be implemented more easily due to the clear separation of concerns.

- **Loose coupling**:
  - Components are decoupled, promoting modularity and making the system easier to understand.
  - Loose coupling allows for greater flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements.

## Considerations

While clean architecture provides numerous advantages, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

- **Learning curve**:
  - Clean architecture requires a shift in mindset and understanding of the underlying architectural principles.
  - Developers new to clean architecture may need to invest time in learning and adapting to this approach.

- **Time-consuming**:
  - Implementing clean architecture involves careful planning and design upfront.
  - Separating concerns and defining interfaces between layers can be more time-consuming compared to traditional approaches.

## Conclusion

Clean architecture is a domain-centric approach that emphasizes organizing dependencies and separating core business logic from infrastructure concerns. It promotes testability, easier code changes, and loose coupling. However, it requires an initial investment of time and effort to understand and implement effectively.
